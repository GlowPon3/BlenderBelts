Blender file includes geometry nodes that will generate a timing gear and equivalent timing belt.

Defaults are for 3GT timing belt, but everything can be adjusted.

Check the included reference image for explanation of measurements.

Note: Some tooth counts will produce invalid meshes, also changing bevel radius too much can also cause invalid mesh.

Variables:
Tooth Radius: The radius of the tooth lobes on the belt.  The bending point of the belt is calculated at 2 x this number from the tip of the tooth.
Number of Teeth: The number of teeth for the pulley or belt.
Pitch: The distance between the center of two teeth on the belt.
Depth: The Width of the belt or Thickness of the pulley.
Beveling radius: The additional hemispheres added to the flat part of the pulley to reduce cutting into the belt when generating a pulley.  Also used to reduce thickness of the belt between teeth when generating a belt.
Gear toggle: Enables generation of the pulley from the Geometry Nodes.
Belt toggle: Enables generation of the belt from the Geoetry Nodes.
